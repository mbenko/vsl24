# VS Live Orlando 2024 - Mike Benkovich


## Fast Focus : GitHub Actions

Address challenges with getting started with GitHub Actions. From understanding triggers, the architecture of runners, jobs, steps and actions, to debugging and testing, to securing secrets we will explore how you can get started with GitHub actions and take pro-tips on how to make the most of them.

GitHub is one of the most popular code sharing tools available, and Actions allow us to respond to changes in the code to automate tasks that need to happen to deliver value from that code. In this session we'll take a look at GitHub Actions, the YAML format it uses to define workflows and explore how we can apply patterns and practices to turn our code into running software.

You will learn:

- How do I get started with GitHub Actions
- What you can I do to secure secrets but manage access
- How to reuse components and build complex workflow

Workflows

- Hello World
- Triggers
- Debugging
- Secrets
- Composite

## Core to Containers to Orchestration

Azure started as a Platform as a Service with Cloud Services, but since it launched has evolved to include several newer and very useful options for compute. Depending on your hosting model and how you do DevOps, requirements for scalability and availability you have tradeoffs that affect your long-term costs and decision. In this session we look at how containerization has altered the landscape and to go from a monolith mindset to microservices requires more than wishful thinking or a management edict. As the cloud advances, we need to understand the tradeoffs between compute options and make smart decisions on what makes the most sense to ensure you can get where you're going.

You will learn:

- How to build and debug microservices with .NET
- How to manage containerization
- What options you have for running compute in Azure
